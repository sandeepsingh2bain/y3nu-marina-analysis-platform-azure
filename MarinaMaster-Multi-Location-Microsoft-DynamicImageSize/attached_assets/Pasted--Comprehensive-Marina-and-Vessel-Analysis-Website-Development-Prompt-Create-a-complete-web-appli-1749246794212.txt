# Comprehensive Marina and Vessel Analysis Website - Development Prompt

Create a complete web application for marina slip and vessel analysis using satellite/aerial imagery. The application should be fully functional, production-ready, and self-contained.

## Core Functionality Requirements

### 1. User Interface Components
- **Input Section:**
  - Two coordinate input fields for bounding box (top-left lat/lng, bottom-right lat/lng)
  - Zoom level selector (dropdown: 16-20)
  - Area validation with 20-tile limit enforcement
  - "Analyze Area" button with loading states

- **Display Section:**
  - Large canvas/container for tiled map display
  - Interactive overlay for detection annotations
  - Toggle switches for showing/hiding boats vs empty slips
  - Zoom and pan controls for detailed inspection

- **Results Section:**
  - Tabular data display with sortable columns
  - Summary statistics dashboard
  - Export functionality (CSV, JSON)

### 2. Backend Processing Requirements
- **Google Static Maps Integration:**
  - Calculate required tiles from lat/lng bounds and zoom level
  - Fetch and stitch map tiles seamlessly
  - Handle API rate limits and errors gracefully
  - Tile limit validation (max 20 tiles)

- **Computer Vision Pipeline:**
  - Boat/vessel detection with bounding boxes
  - Empty marina slip detection and boundary identification
  - Length/width measurement using map scale calculations
  - Confidence scoring for all detections

- **Data Processing:**
  - Convert pixel measurements to real-world distances
  - Classification of detected objects (boat types, slip types)
  - Occupancy analysis (occupied vs empty slips)
  - Size matching analysis (boat fit within slips)

### 3. Detection Categories and Measurements

**Boats/Vessels:**
- Automatic length and width measurement in meters
- Orientation/heading calculation
- Type classification (sailboat, motorboat, yacht)
- Position coordinates (lat/lng)

**Marina Wet Slips:**
- Empty slip detection and boundary marking
- Slip dimensions (length x width)
- Slip type identification (finger pier, side-tie)
- Occupancy status determination

**Analytics:**
- Occupancy rate calculations
- Size compatibility analysis
- Density metrics per area
- Capacity utilization statistics

### 4. Results Table Structure
Create a comprehensive data table with these columns:
- Object ID (auto-generated)
- Object Type (Boat, Empty Slip, Occupied Slip)
- Coordinates (lat/lng)
- Dimensions (Length x Width in meters)
- Area (square meters)
- Status (for slips: Empty/Occupied; for boats: classification)
- Confidence Score (0-100%)
- Notes/Manual Override field

### 5. Technical Implementation Details

**Frontend Technologies:**
- Modern HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet use
- Canvas or WebGL for map rendering and annotations
- Interactive data tables with sorting/filtering
- Real-time progress indicators

**Backend Requirements:**
- RESTful API architecture
- Google Static Maps API integration
- Computer vision processing (use YOLO, Detectron2, or cloud vision APIs)
- Image processing libraries for stitching and analysis
- Database for storing analysis results (optional)

**Key Algorithms Needed:**
- Coordinate system conversion (lat/lng to pixel coordinates)
- Image stitching for seamless tile combination
- Object detection and classification
- Geometric measurement calculations
- Boundary detection for marina infrastructure

### 6. Error Handling and Validation
- Coordinate input validation
- API quota/rate limit management
- Area size validation (20-tile maximum)
- Detection confidence thresholds
- Graceful degradation for failed API calls

### 7. User Experience Features
- **Interactive Map:**
  - Click on table rows to highlight objects on map
  - Hover effects for better object identification
  - Zoom controls for detailed inspection

- **Data Management:**
  - Export results to CSV/Excel format
  - Manual correction capabilities for measurements
  - Bulk operations for managing detections
  - Save/load analysis sessions

- **Summary Dashboard:**
  - Total counts and statistics
  - Occupancy rate visualization
  - Size distribution charts
  - Performance metrics display

### 8. Configuration Options
- Adjustable confidence thresholds for detection
- Minimum/maximum size filters for objects
- Toggle between metric and imperial units
- Customizable detection sensitivity settings

## Implementation Notes
- Ensure all API keys are configurable via environment variables
- Implement proper error messages and user feedback
- Add loading states and progress indicators for long operations
- Make the interface intuitive for non-technical marina operators
- Include sample coordinates for testing/demonstration
- Optimize for performance with large imagery datasets
- Consider offline capability for processed results

## Deliverables Expected
1. Complete working web application
2. Clean, documented code structure
3. User guide/documentation
4. API key setup instructions
5. Deployment-ready configuration
6. Sample test cases with known marina locations

Build this as a professional-grade tool suitable for marina operators, harbor masters, and marine facility managers. Focus on accuracy, usability, and practical real-world application.
